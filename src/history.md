I've made multiple sites for this very purpose only to see them migrated from one ecosystem to another. The most current lineage is as follows:

1. [Jekyll][jk]
1. [MiddleMan][mm]
1. [Metalsmith][ms]
1. [GatsbyJS][gs]
1. [Hugo][hg]
1. [11ty][11ty]

I've always found a reason to move on; mostly I move on to keep myself interested or to  learn something else. To that end with this current rendition my noble challenge/goal is to attempt to craft everything using vim, well NeoVim.

Things may work, things may not work and things may break. As a result, nothing here should be considered finished, polished, refined or ready for mass consumption. With any luck, I will continue to develop this space into an unique blend of tech, running and everything I find interesting.
