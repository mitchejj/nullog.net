I must admit back in the day when I first 'learned' UNIX my terminal text editor of choice was pico and eventually nano. Year, decades later I'm picking up vim, well neovim, and finding it rather nice and comfy. I rater regret not spending more time back in the day attempting to learn vim. I'm sure I would have ignored it away as it wasn't graphical, just another what if.

Just some useful vim resources:
