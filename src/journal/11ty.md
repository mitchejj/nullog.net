title: the 11ty move

The last time I moved platforms was to make everything simple; I thought that is what I wanted. I was wrong, and I can admit it. Yes, I like the idea of having a basic where I didn't need to worry about how the site looked across different platforms and screen sizes. Yet that is the only part of having a basic theme that I enjoyed, well that and having a more polished look. I suppose in retrospect I just wasn't enjoying the tools I was using before making the move.

The last time I was happy with the tools I was using was back when I was using [MiddleMan][mm]. I moved away from MiddleMan because the next major version broke some functionality I was relaying on, the Ruby tooling starting to feel dated, and mostly a lot of interesting javascript projects start to crop up. All of that would require a significant amount of time and create new edge cases.

With each move I've made I've add technical debt which has lead to data fragmentation. I would like to clean up some of that debt and organize my data. My learning goals for this project are rather simple.

Going forward for the date I will use:

    date --rfc-3339=ns | sed 's/ /T/'

    :r !date --rfc-3339=ns | sed 's/ /T/'
