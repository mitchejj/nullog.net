I need a consistent date format `date --rfc-3339=ns | sed 's/ /T/'` fits my needs and to easily enter with vim:

    :r !date --rfc-3339=ns | sed 's/ /T/'

When using Hugo I was heavily reliant on submodules. This time around the plan is to use [git-subrepo][git-subrepo]. I am still trying to figure out the proper work flow. What I currently think is the proper way to to push changes for a submodule upstream is by:

    git subrepo push <sub repo>

If changes have been made outside of the project and I need to update those changes I would need to run:

    git subrepo pull <sub repo>

However I was wrong, I'm not sure what I did to make this work once before. Maybe this approach continues to be a folly.

#### Planning
Things I still need to do

* Figure out how to store/merge the distinct data sets of weblog and backlog
    * An idea
        * /backlog should contain a listing of all post
        * /weblog would just have the last 2-3 posts with a link to /backlog
    * the vh of a generic page is over sized
    * rss or json feed?
    * human.txt
    * robots.txt
    * sitemap
    * better handing/one location for images
        * processing the image sizes to better fix screen sizes
    * darksky website is shutting down, should obtain screen shoots for Dopey
      2018 weather links
    * a running page
        * PR's
        * links to race posts
    * tags
    * error page
