We all have our digital lives scattered across multiple online services; the `nullog.net` domain serves as my primary online home.

### /whoami/
I'm now 40-something who doesn't totally get they usefulness of many nifty new tech advances, outside of a few demos. I like to think I adopted technology early, I started driving a hybrid car ealry into the second generation of Prius I also had an orginal iPhone. Growing up I loved gadgets and tinkering with widgets; When it came time for college the natural choice was computer science. I hold a degree in Computer Science from [Grand Valley State University][gvsu], during my senior year, what has best been described as an RSI started flare up. Ultimately as my career path diverged my interested evolved.

In 2019 I challenged myself to attempt to use an iPad as my main personal computing device for a year. Looking back I started to realize my daily personal computing needs may no longer be best served with a laptop.

### History

I've made multiple sites for this very purpose only to see them migrated from one ecosystem to another. The most current lineage is as follows:

[Jekyll][jk] -> [MiddleMan][mm] -> [Metalsmith][ms] -> [GatsbyJS][gs] -> [Hugo][hg] -> [11ty][11ty]

I always find a reason to move on mostly, I move on to keep myself interested in something new and different. To that end with this current rendition my noble challenge/goal is to attempt to craft everything using neovim. Things may work, things may not work and things may break. As a result, nothing here should be considered finished, polished, refined or ready for mass consumption. With any luck, I will continue to develop this space into an unique blend of tech, running and everything I find interesting.
