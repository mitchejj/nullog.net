The best place to start would be a quick explanation of 'mitchejj', simply it is my old college network user id.

I'm now a 40-something who doesn't totally get they usefulness of many nifty new tech advances, outside of a few demos. I like to think I adopted technology early, I started driving a hybrid car early into the second generation of Prius I also had an original iPhone. Growing up I loved gadgets and tinkering with widgets; When it came time for college the natural choice was computer science. I hold a degree in Computer Science from [Grand Valley State University][gvsu], during my senior year, what has best been described as an RSI started flare up. Ultimately as my career path diverged my interested evolved.

In 2019 I challenged myself to attempt to use an iPad as my main personal computing device for a year. Looking back I started to realize my daily personal computing needs may no longer be best served with a laptop.
