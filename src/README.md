### ~/jason

We all have our digital lives scattered across multiple online services; the `nullog.net` domain serves as my primary online home.

#### History

I've made multiple sites for this very purpose only to see them migrated from one ecosystem to another. The most current lineage is as follows:

Jekyll -> MiddleMan -> Metalsmith -> GatsbyJS -> Hugo -> 11ty

I always find a reason to move on mostly, I move on to keep myself interested in something new and different. To that end with this current rendition my noble challenge/goal is to attempt to craft everything using neovim.
